Instructions for use with Photoshop or Gimp or any other image editing software

You can use the included PNG images with these software programs. 

For images labeled as 'normal color,' you can use them as-is in all of your image software. 

For images labeled as 'sample color,' if you want to create a transparent background and only keep the outlines so you can add your own colors, it's best to put the layer with the image(s) in 'multiply' mode. This will make the white color completely transparent, allowing you to keep only the black lines.

For images labeled as 'custom color,' you can choose your own colors by changing the hue of each of the three primary colors separately.
