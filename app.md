# Project: Pirate Wizard Codegrindr

# Business Context

Dating apps are used to bring people with similar interests together and set them up on dates. There are many unexplored niches in the matchmaking industry.

# Problem Statement

Pirate-Wizard segregation is a societal seed for discrimination and oppression. Through social engineering, we will reduce this divide and promote equality across the seven seas and realms.

# Scope

This app will be available via web browsers and viewable from desktop only and if you view it on a phone it blows up the phone.

The scope of the app is aimed at a pirate-wizard demographic only and will not expand to accommodate other demographics.

# Assumptions 

Each person who uses the app has access to a desktop computer and is okay with only using it when they have access.

Users will be distinguishable via their unique username and password.

# Features

A user without an account will be unable to use the app without one, and will be prompted to do so.

The user will be able to log in using their username and password.

The app will grant the user a session which will remain valid for a length of time and allow the user to avoid re-logging

The user must verify legal age through a curse

The user will be able to build their own profile with pictures, descriptions, and general answers to text prompts.

The user will be able to view the profiles of other algorithmically selected users.

Algorithm could be anything from (select next user from list) to (use applicable data to select a most relevant user)

The user will be able to "like" other users' profiles.

Users who mutually "like" one another will be provided an opportunity to chat.

Users can upgrade their experience through a purchase, providing premium features
